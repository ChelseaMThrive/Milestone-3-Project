This is the README file for Milestone Project 3.  

This is the first file recruiters and potential employers will see when they open the GitHub repo for this project.

Use this space to give context for the project and guide visitors to the materials you've created.  While you don't want to make this README too long, you do want to give any reader enough information to understand your project and navigate your repo.

Begin by giving a brief description of your Milestone 3 project.  Share that this is the final project for your certificate program in Data Science and Analytics and that - for this project - you proposed and answered a real-world problem problem using machine learning.

Write a one-paragraph executive summary about your project including some background on your research question and stakeholders, information about your data and the model you chose to run and your conclusions.  

Finally, clearly link to your project plan, data and slide deck to make sure future employers can find those resources easily.
